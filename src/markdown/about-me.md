Hello there,

Thank you for reaching out to this website. 
I am Youngyun currently living in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
This website is about me, what I have done, what I am able to do, etc. If you would like to collaborate with me or have any questions, feel free to contact me. I am always here.

I graduated in Visual Communication Design and dived into development to deploy the prototype on the screen. I started front-end development first, and now I am able to organise database and communicate with server-side. All javascript frameworks are favourite. Furthermore, I would like to consider both security and performance to create highly sophisticated systems. So, I have kept taking online courses or reading articles related to computer science.
